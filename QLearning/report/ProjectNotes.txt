--- Q Learning ---

Q(s,a)←Q(s,a)+α[r+γ*maxQ(s',a)-Q(s,a)] 

Q-Learning Term		Your Code Equivalent
s (state)		CurrentState = EncodeState()
a (action)		SelectedAction = ChooseAction(CurrentState)
r (reward)		Reward = GetReward()
s' (new state)		NewState = EncodeState() (after action)
Q-value update		UpdateQValue(CurrentState, SelectedAction, Reward, NewState)



			- Q Learning Notes -
SMALL State & Action Space
More rewards are fine

			- Reward Values -

Implemented
Successful Attack: +1		(in Knight Get_Hit)
Successful Dodge: +0.25		(QEnemy OnDodgeEnd)
Being Hit: -1			(QEnemy Get_Hit)
Target Dies: +10		(in Knight Get_Hit or Die)
Self Dies: -10			(QEnemy Get_Hit or Die)
Healing: +0.25			(QEnemy SetToHealing)
Attacked outside Range: -1.f	(QEnemy)
Attacked inside Range: +1.f	(QEnemy)
Swing and miss: -0.75		(Weapon)
Dodge Target Attack: +0.5	(QEnemy)
Guard Target Attack: +0.35	(Weapon)





			- Places Calling Update -
QEnemy -> at a steady interval
Target -> after reward (in Get_Hit)




			- Storage -
Options:
	- FString with FFileHelper	(easiest)
	- FArchive with binary files	(better long term)
	- FJsonObject as .json		(most flexible)




			- Optimization -
Storage + Lookup:
	State:
	- Compressed FString for State
	- Raw Keys or Hashes for State instead of FString




			- Shared QTable - Q Manager -
QEnemy(s) -QTable-> QManager (avg tables) -> save To Disk on EndPlay



			- Ending Notes -
Add more rewards for things like: attacked if in combat range (or change distance to bool InTargetRange or delete)

QEnemy Test Run #1: 
Only attacked then got stuck in wait state and stopped chasing (CHECK rewards, chasing function, attack function) 
Attack Issue: Spammed attacks randomly at a pace that shouldn't be allowed (much too fast)
Exploration should be increased or looked at, only two actions were taken

Figure out storage, possibly using QManager





			- BUG REPORT -
BUG 1
Major Issue, crashing after a few seconds every play through:
Tests in weapon onBoxOverlap, Enemy, QEnemy Ticks, QLearning Functions
MoveTo and InRange functions - all halted with if(true) return;

Culprit for QLearningEnemy: GuardMontage not set in editor,
PlayRandomMontageSection:
	if (Montage->GetNumSections() <= 0) return; causing editor to crash
Change:
	if (!Montage || Montage->GetNumSections() <= 0) return;
